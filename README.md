# homeworkSix
Sixth homework project for UC Davis Coding bootcamp. Creating a weather application.
Struggled with understanding accessing content of api. Mainly worked on study to understand concepts involved in project. would have liked to produce a cleaner styled more cohesive document. FURTHER LEARNING PLANNED: Add a catch function for incorrect inputs.
Wanted to try a more cartoonish style for this project, adding a sort of tv looking element to house my content.
